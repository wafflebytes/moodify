  ## About
  Moodify transforms your emotional state and daily context into perfectly curated music experiences. This advanced AI-powered system uses OpenAI gpt-4o to analyze multiple parameters including your mood, current activity, recent life events, energy level, genre preferences, time of day, weather conditions, wellness goals, and preferred music pace to generate highly personalized playlists.

  ## How It Works
  The system creates comprehensive music recommendations by applying a sophisticated weighted algorithm (Involving min-max scaling and variance controlled normalization, including composite scoring) that prioritizes the most impactful factors in your current context. Each generated playlist contains 20-30 unique songs, carefully selected and arranged to ensure smooth transitions and consistent audio quality.

  For each playlist, Moodify provides detailed explanations of why each song was chosen, how it aligns with your input parameters, and its role in the overall listening experience. The system also generates individual parameter-specific playlists to help you understand how each factor influences the music selection.
